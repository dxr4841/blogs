                <h3>Conflict</h3>
                <p>11/30/2014</p>
                <p>Throughout life you will encounter different conflicts some can be avoid but in my cases these conflicts are unavoidable.</p>
                <p>When I was a freshmen in college I leaved in a dorm room another person and we got along well most of the time. However, there was this period of time when my roommate felt I betrayed his trust and we just didn&rsquo;t talk about it. I knew he was angry with me and knew that we would have talk about the situation at some point. But, I kept putting it because he didn&rsquo;t spend much time in the room and I just wanted to avoid the problem. Finally, it got to the point where almost everyone on my floor knew there was a problem and one of the director for housing had to sit us down and have us talk it out. During that talk thing got cleared up and we were able to get past our issue. Looking bad at that situation I know now that I handle it poorly. I probably should have decided the issue with him earlier and try to understand how he felt about the situation. Avoiding did nothing make thing worst.</p>
