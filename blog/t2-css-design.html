                <h2>Week 1 Phase 0</h2>
                <h3>Classes vs IDs</h3>
                <p>10/19/2014</p>
                <p>
                   Here we are again fellow boot campers and other beginners like myself. It&#x2019;s the end of week 2 and I want talk briefly about what was cover this week. This week covered developing your own website from the sitemap at the very beginning to the writing your own HTML and CSS. And what comes to mine when I think about HTML and CSS is element selectors.
                </p>
                <p>I know element selectors don&#x2019;t seem very exciting but they are still important in building a website that can be maintained and updated.  Talking about selectors there two things that come to mind that is IDs and Classes. But, when should we use you are probably wondering. Well here is short guide using them. </p>
                <p>The next thing that you need to know is that naming for classes and id should not be abstract. You want be specific I repeat you want to be specific. And when I say specific I don&#x2019;t mean abbreviations. Abbreviations are a big no no in most cases.</p>
                <p>The last thing I want to touch upon is don&#x2019;t over use IDs and Classes. Many time element don&#x2019;t need to be singled out or put in a group they just need to be elements. Too many IDs and classes can be confusing and just make your style bigger than it need to be.</p>
                <p>Thank you for your time until next time.</p>
