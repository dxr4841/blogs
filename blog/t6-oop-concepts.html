                <h2>Week 6 Phase 0</h2>
                <h3>Variable Scope</h3>
                <p>11/16/2014</p>
                <p>This week in DBC we started getting into object oriented programming using Ruby. There were many concepts covered but I want to talk to you about variable scope. Ruby five different variable types which are the following:</p>
                <ul>
                	<li>Gllobal Variables</li>                	
                	<li>Constant Variables</li>
                	<li>Class Variables</li>
                	<li>Instance Variables</li>
                	<li>Local Variable</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Each type of variable has their own rules and scopes that when using them.</p>
                <h4>Global Variables</h4>
                <p>Global variables are variables that have a global scope. What this means is that global variable can be access in any part of a program. Since they can be accessed anywhere it is not recommended to be used. All global names start with a &lsquo;$&rsquo; at the beginning of the variable name. Even through it recommended not to create global variables there are useful pre-defined global variable in Ruby that you should check out went to you get the chance.</p>
                <h4>Constant Variables</h4>
                <p>Constant variable are similar to global variables when it comes to scope. Constant variables can be accessed anywhere in a program and should never be changed, think of constant as the value of Pi. Constant variables should be use as variables that you use to reference but never change. However, Ruby does allow you to change the value of a constant variable but gives you a warning when it happens. Constant variable must start with an uppercased letter.</p>
                <h4>Class Variables</h4>
                <p>Class variables are variable that can be access in every instance of a class. Think of it as a global variable for the class only. If you make changes to a class variable in one instance of the class the change happens in every instance. I would suggest only using class variable to keep track of some data by adding elements to an array or hash that is a class variable until you get a better understand of how to use it. Every class variable must start with &lsquo;@@&rsquo; at the beginning of the variable name.</p>
                <h4>Instance Variables</h4>
                <p>Instance variables are variables that can be accessed anywhere insider an instance of a class. What this means is this variable can be used by any block of code that is need the same instance of the class it is in. These variables become very important when want to access variable it different methods or code blacks in a class. Instance variables must start with &lsquo;@&rsquo;.</p>
                <h4>Local Variables</h4>
                <p>Local variable are the variables with the smallest scope. Local variable are only access by the current block of code it is in including blocks within that block. In most cases local variables are the variables you will probably create the most. Local variables have the safest scope and are variable that do the least harm when they go wrong. Local variable must be created with a lowercase letter at the beginning.</p>
                <p>Hope this was helpful to fellow beginners.</p>
