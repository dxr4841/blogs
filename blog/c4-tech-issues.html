                <h3>Diversity</h3>
                <p>11/2/2014</p>
                <p>Today going to talk about issue that affects me personal and part of the reason I decided to sign up for DBC, this issue being the lack of diversity in the tech industry. Some of you may be thinking this isn&rsquo;t an issue but I finds to be an issue that is drawing the attention of many people these days. The tech and innovation industries are driving our economy these and it&rsquo;s difficult to believe that these industries are not drawing in a more diverse crowd when it comes to employment and entrepreneurship.</p>
                <p>But, there has to be a solution to this problem or there has be at least a way of starting change. This where it gets a little personal for me, because I have two brother which are both software engineers. My older has been working in this industry for more than 15 years and my younger has been working at Facebook for the last 3 years. They both the reason I about in DBC today and both agree that a lack of diversity is an issue in this industry. The problem from speaking to them seems to be there are just not enough minorities seeking careers in this issue.</p>
                <p>The solution for this issue seem to be pretty simple just expose young minorities and women to these industries a younger age. Well I think that is just part of the solution to the problem. I spoke about my younger brother working for Facebook earlier, well past few months he been traveling meeting young people to help promote diverse in the tech industry. I feel that young people seeing a person that looks like them help believe that they could work needed to learn how to be an engineer. So, feel that industry can get start to see growth when companies start showing the next generation that they are hiring people that look like them so it&rsquo;s possible for them to reach that goal.</p>
                <p>One last thing, I feel like programs like DBC are part of the solution for this issue. DBC gives people who were not a part of this industry early in their careers a chance to learn and be ready for the jobs.</p>
