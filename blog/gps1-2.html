      <h3>What is Pair Programming?</h3>
      <p>Pair programming is the process of programming alongside another person, which we call Pairing. 
      It is heavily used by Developers, especially at Dev Bootcamp. To pair with someone, you:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>Check-in</li>
        <li>Discuss your workflow style</li>
        <li>Decide who will Drive and who will Navigate first</li>
        <li>Switch roles</li>
        <li>Give Feedback</li>
        <li>*FISTBUMP* at your success!</li>
      </ol>
      
      <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
      <p>Pair programming, or "pairing", is important for various reasons:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Pairing with another person gives you another set of eyes on your code, aleviating you from
          having many errors pop-up from having tunnel vision as you write your code.
        </li>
        <li>Pairing allows for different perspectives that help you contribute a broad set 
        of knowledge to your code.</li>
        <li>When you pair with another programmer, having the opoprtunity to discuss your code 
        can build understanding about your coding style, and help move you forward when you get stuck</li>
        <li>Working in teams is fun, and useful! Having a culture that promotes pair programming 
        also breaks the "lone coder in the corner" stereotype many people have about developers.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <h3>Driving and Navigating, what's that?</h3>
      <p>Driving and Navigating are the two roles you use when pairing.</p>
      <p>The driver's role is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To type the code out</li>
          <li>To keep an eye on the syntax</li>
          <li>To push the programming process forward</li>
        </ul>
      <p>The navigator's role is:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>To Keep an eye on the flow of the programming, and where the pair is going</li>
          <li>To research and relay the information to the driver</li>
          <li>To keep a step back from the code, and see how the code is working</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

        <p>The first time I paired I was nervous because afraid of doing something wrong or not knowing enough. But, I learned shortly into the session that my pair was in the same boat and we could relate. I realized that we were both there to learn and we began to get to work. I enjoyed my first section because me and pair communicated well. We were able to get most of the challenges done. But, since it was a early pairing there were computer issues but besides that it was good.</p>
