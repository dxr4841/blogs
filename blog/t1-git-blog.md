Week 1 Phase 0

10/10/2014

So my first week of Phase 0 DBC is nearly completed and I can’t help but think to 2006 when I was a freshman in a software 
engineering. Back then, I had my first experience coding and learning a programming language. Back then I had problem with two 
things that git and GitHub would have help me with. Those are two things happen to be version control which git takes care of and 
collaborative work which GitHub helps you with. 

Looking back then I really didn’t have a good way to do version control. I would have dozens of file in a folder with the same 
name with a “v” and some number at the end. It was really hard to keep track of what version of the file I worked on last or what 
version actual worked. It became whelming and difficult not to get lost in the middle of long projects. I look back at now and I 
wish I had git. Git make version control very simple and easy to follow. I look forward to having version control that actually 
keeps track of every change I commit and having to ability to revert to a previous version seamlessly.
 
Collaborative work was a problem as well because there was never a common place where the groups work could stay. Different 
members of the team would have different versions of the code and it would hard to keep track of who did what. GitHub makes 
collaboration so easy because it is that common location I was speaking of.  GitHub provide a hub for lack of a better word where 
everyone working can stay and be reviewed. This would have prevented a lot of code overlaps and problem back when I was a 
freshmen.

I’m just glad I have these tools now.
