                <h2>Kitchen vs. Table</h2>
                <p>10/10/2014</p>
                <p>I just finish watching the fireside chat with Shereef and I now feel so much better about my decision to join DBC. I know that DBC
will be a lot of work and will be the hardest things I ever done in my life. I know I am a very reserve person and will probably 
be put outside my comfort constantly. I know will make more mistakes than I can count and will be lost from time to time. But, I 
as know I will be able to learn.</p>

                <p>DBC seem like the perfect opportunity for me to learn so much and change my current path. Shereef talked about the kitchen vs. the
table and I definitely want to see myself as a kitchen person. I have been the table person most my life and I have never really been 
happy about my education because of that. I feel DBC is the time and place I can get exactly what I want as long as I work on it.</p>

                <p>To my fellow cohorts I ask you to work with me as I work with you.</p>
