                <h4>Exploring your Values</h4>
                <p>When I think of the times in my life where I&rsquo;ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, the following values come to mind:</p>
                <p>
                Achievement<br />
                Commitment<br />
                Challenge<br />
                Faith<br />
                Friendships<br />
                Growth<br />
                Having a family<br />
                Helping others<br />
                Integrity<br />
                Music<br />
                Personal development<br />
                Privacy<br />
                 <hr>
                </p>
                <h4>Privacy</h4>
                <p>Privacy is important value to me because I feel there are something that I don&rsquo;t need to be shared with others. I see privacy as way that you control things about yourself and I feel having that control is what keeps me level headed. I feel that when you have privacy in your life you&rsquo;re able to control how certain things are shared in your life. I feel for me personally the amount and type of private information I share with someone helps me understand how important that person is in my life. So I use privacy as a way to define many of my relationships.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Values in your Life</h4>
                <p>In general, I try to live up to these values:</p>
                <p>Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</p>
                <p>Achievement - 3<br />
                Commitment - 4<br />
                Challenge - 4<br />
                Faith -5<br />
                Friendships -2<br />
                Growth -4<br />
                Having a family - 4<br />
                Helping others - 3<br />
                Integrity - 5<br />
                Music -2<br />
                Personal development - 5<br />
                Privacy - 4<br />
                <hr>
                </p>
                <h4>Advice</h4>
                <p>One of the last topic someone asked me for advice on is dealing with a unfair coworker. I this person if the coworker is someone that is not important in their life to keep your distant from them avoid reacting quickly when dealing with this coworker.</p>
                <hr>
                <h4>Values and Stereotype threat</h4>
                <p>When it comes to my values I feel that are what get me through many of my day to day activities and deal with the stresses that I my feel. When it comes to my values dealing with stereotype threat I do feel that the values I choosing in life helps me deal. Like, one of the threats that young black males deal with is be knew for being dishonest and having not commitment. But, the thing that are important to me are being able to commit and have integrity in all things. So, as long as I keep these values in mind I usually don&rsquo;t have to deal with many of my stereotype threats. However, there are still going to be time when I feel down and at point I feel that being able to open up to other people will help.</p>
