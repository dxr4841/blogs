                <h3>Stereotype Threats</h3>
                <p>11/16/2014</p>
                <p>Throughout my life I have heard and seen different stereotypes use be to descript people of different culture or racial background. These stereotypes have been used in both positive and negative light. Growing up I&rsquo;ve told not to let stereotypes defined me as a person and be may own person. However, there are still these Stereotype Threats that haunt me to this day.</p>
                <p>Claude M. Steele refers to Stereotype Threat being at risk of confirming, as self-characteristic, a negative stereotype about one's group. I&rsquo;ve experience Stereotype Threat throughout high school all the way up to now when I was seeking employment. During my high school I would always try my best to make everything I do look effortless. I was going to a high school where most of the student body were white students. The school was outside of the town I lived and area the school was in had families lived a different means than what my family had. Having all of these thing that set me apart from the normal student it was easy for me labeled as the less fortunate black kid from out of town. But, during high school I tried my best to not be perceived as that. I would make sure I the other students know that was smart and it wasn&rsquo;t a big deal to me. I guess what I&rsquo;m trying to say is the way I dealt with stereotype treat was basically showing them I wasn&rsquo;t the norm.</p>
                <p>As, I went to college I felt like whole situation switch because I was no longer the smart black student in a class of white student. I was now the black student that didn&rsquo;t previous programming knowledge trying to be a software engineer. At this point I really feared being the student that couldn&rsquo;t make it because it was increasingly difficult to get help from my peers because didn&rsquo;t want others confirming that I was living up to stereotypes. It got so bad to the point where I ended up switching my major to a major I knew I had friend I could work with. This ended up being one of my biggest regrets to this day and part of the reason I&rsquo;m doing dbc now.</p>
