Cultural Blog: Chefs in the Kitchen

Kitchen vs. Table

10/10/2014

I just finish watching the fireside chat with Shereef and I now feel so much better about my decision to join DBC. I know that DBC
will be a lot of work and will be the hardest things I ever done in my life. I know I am a very reserve person and will probably 
be put outside my comfort constantly. I know will make more mistakes than I can count and will be lost from time to time. But, I 
as know I will be able to learn.

DBC seem like the perfect opportunity for me to learn so much and change my current path. Shereef talked about the kitchen vs. the
table and I definitely want to see myself as a kitchen person. I’ve been the table person most my life and I’ve never really been 
happy about my education because of that. I feel DBC is the time and place I can get exactly what I want as long as I work on it.

To my fellow cohorts I ask you to work with me as I work with you.
