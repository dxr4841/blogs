                <h3>Pairing and Giving Feedback</h3>
                <p>11/9/2014</p>
                <h4>Pairing</h4>
               <p>This week want to talk about pairing and feedback. Throughout my short time in Phase 0 of DBC I&rsquo;ve gotten the chance to work with fellow DBCer in pairing session. My experience with doing pairing session has left me with a mix of feeling and learning. I remember one pairing session where I was feeling frustrated because we just could figure out how to pass a couple of rspec test, the code did what it had to do but it just would pass the test. We started to do research during the session to come up with a solution and finally found something that worked. At that point felt really good because we put the time in and bounced ideas to get to a solution. I know if wasn&rsquo;t in a pairing session I would have been very closed minded and very come with a solution that would work but, with a pair I was able open up more a try things I would probably never try. But, besides the frustrating there are time where you get rewarding pairing session. There was a pairing session that I had this past weekend where it I understood the concepts of the challenge very well because of my programming experience before DBC. Well, pair was struggling to understand the concept because DBC is their first programming experience. So, instead of just breezing through the work I decided to focus on my pairs understand and made sure they understood what was going on. At end of the session my pair thanked me for being patience with them. Its session like that really make be glad that DBC does the pairing session.</p>
               <h4>Feedback</h4>
               <p>Giving a receive feedback for the pairing session was probably the strangest thing about pairing session at first. I mean after spend short amount of time working with someone a few challenge I found it hard to give feedback. The reason I find it hard to give feedback because during the session I don&rsquo;t really think about what went wrong or right. I focus on the learning itself and if I feel my pair is learning. So, I usually put a little time between when the session happens get a better understand of what really went on during the session. I see it like this if I don&rsquo;t informed and level headed feedback I won&rsquo;t be helping the other person in the long run. As for the feedback I&rsquo;ve receive from other it I have to say it it has been helpful. Some pointed out something that I need improvement in and that helpful. For example, some of the feedback I got told me there time where I tell my pair I need a few moments to think or do research. During that time I usually just think to myself which is good if I&rsquo;m working by myself. But, I should focus more talking out my thoughts because it help my pair know what&rsquo;s going on. I feel like feedback like that has been helpful and I&rsquo;ve been working on improving from the feedback.</p>
