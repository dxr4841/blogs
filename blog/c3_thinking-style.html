                <h3>Your Thinking Style and Learning</h3>
                <p>10/26/2014</p>
                <p>My biggest struggle for me right now has to be time boxing. I think it is related to the way I think and learn. When doing work for DBC I find myself trying to become an expert on every topic I learn. This doesn&rsquo;t really happen but what does happen is I will spend so much time trying to be more thorough then I have to be. Like, event this week I feel I spent way too much on the tech blog to the point I just had to end it because I would of gone on forever in my mind. But, I do feel I can overcome my time boxing issue by putting hard stops to my work time. If I tell myself that if I don&rsquo;t get x and y done by this time to bad. I have to teach myself that going overtime is not acceptable. I think if I just try to become more aware of time I will be able to overcome this struggle.</p>
